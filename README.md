# 1944 - Downfall

A Hearts of Iron IV mod by **gastav3**: the Second World War from 1 January
1944. On the Steam Workshop:
[1944 - Downfall](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3070639276).

## The September 2026 update

This updates the mod for HOI4 1.19.3, fixes bugs, and adds 1944–45 content.
**None of it has been play-tested yet.**

Nothing was moved: the mod stays at the top level of this repository, and
this repository's line-ending setting (`* text=auto`) is unchanged.

**How the commits are organised:**
1. **[`c56a5f1`](https://github.com/gastav3/Hoi4_1944/commit/c56a5f1) Sync with the Steam Workshop version of July
   2026.** This is the author's own work from the July upload that never
   reached GitHub (62 files, for example the new states in the Dutch East
   Indies, Malaya and Indochina). Nothing in it was written by Oscar or the
   AI assistant.
2. **One commit per change**, each with its full reason in the commit
   message: 26 in pull request #2, and 5 more in pull request #3: the home
   front 1944–45, a fix for the Courland popup, the fix for the crash when
   starting as the UK, five war measures for Germany, and a fix for two
   equipment mistakes in the update's own features:

## Documentation

The update package holds the same changes plus the full documentation and
the check scripts, at tag `final-2026-09-29-v12` of
[AnderssonOscar/Hoi4_1944](https://github.com/AnderssonOscar/Hoi4_1944/tree/final-2026-09-29-v12). There the mod sits
in a `mod/` folder, and the commit IDs are the ones in the right-hand column
above; the documents refer to those.

| Document | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [READ-ME-FIRST](https://github.com/AnderssonOscar/Hoi4_1944/blob/final-2026-09-29-v12/docs/READ-ME-FIRST.md) | The update in short: every change in one table |
| [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/AnderssonOscar/Hoi4_1944/blob/final-2026-09-29-v12/docs/CHANGELOG.md) | Every change: what, why, sources, how it was tested, in-game test steps |
| [VERIFICATION](https://github.com/AnderssonOscar/Hoi4_1944/blob/final-2026-09-29-v12/docs/VERIFICATION.md) | How it was checked: 72 automated checks, the game's error logs, checksums |
| [INVESTIGATION](https://github.com/AnderssonOscar/Hoi4_1944/blob/final-2026-09-29-v12/docs/INVESTIGATION.md) | The investigation of the reported crashes, including false alarms |

| [game-logs](https://github.com/AnderssonOscar/Hoi4_1944/tree/final-2026-09-29-v12/docs/game-logs) | The game's error.log after each step |
| [tools](https://github.com/AnderssonOscar/Hoi4_1944/tree/final-2026-09-29-v12/tools) | The check scripts (Python 3) |

## How it was checked

- **In the update package:**
  - 72 automated checks;
  - the game's error.log after every change (115 lines, unchanged by every
    addition since the 1.19.3 update);
  - in-game runs of the new effects, during the game's setup and, since the
    war measures, in a running game with the stockpile measured;
  - a rebuild test: the Steam version plus the patches reproduces the mod
    exactly.
- **For this repository:** after every commit here, the files are identical
  to the tested package at the same step, ignoring only line endings (which
  this repository normalises).
  - Each commit shows the same line changes as the original, with one
    exception: the Siam history rebuild (`c88694e`) counts one more changed
    line. That's the file's last line, because the old file had no newline
    at its end.
  - The sync commit is identical to the Steam copy.
  - A fresh clone loads in the game with the same error.log as the tested
    version.
- **Not tested:** actual play, and playing without some DLCs.

## Status

- **Not play-tested yet.** Each feature's CHANGELOG section lists console
  commands to try it.
- **The UK crash is fixed:** starting as the United Kingdom crashed the game
  at once, also with the Steam version ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/AnderssonOscar/Hoi4_1944/blob/final-2026-09-29-v12/docs/CHANGELOG.md) section 15).
- **Crash reports not yet explained:** Bulgaria switching sides, Romania's
  12-day decision and the Volkssturm focus (redesigned anyway). "D-Day seems
  broken" needs a description.
